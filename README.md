### Plaid Case Study
** Case Study for Plaid Technologies: Banking Smarter

Importance: Plaid bridges a key gap by transmitting large amounts of customer data, primarily transaction information, to banks.Plaid currently has a strong foothold on the financial landscape with more than 10,000 banks connecting and utilizing their services however, they face rising competition in thi space. Plaids mission is to enable FinTech solutions to multiple businesses.

`Competition: Their three main competitors are: XIGNITE, FINICITY, and YODLEE (ENVESTNET).

XIGNITE is uniqye in that it offers its services through a cloud API. Which aggregates financial data on a macro scale.
Finicity brands itself as a leader in security for the banking transaction field. Finicity has also been certified as a credit reporting agency.  It was also founded 1999.  The latest funding round for this company produced $42 million and its revenue for 2016 was $5.8 million.

YODLEE (ENVESTNET) is in direct competition with PLAID and has recently settled a patent lawsuit with them. Their latest funding round produced $75 million and they were acquired for $590 million in 2016.  Their revenue in 2016 was $41,066,000.

Plaid as a FinTech company: Plaid is at the foundation of FinTech. Working with companies such as Venmo, Acorns, American Express, and Coinbase. They use technology to answer a need for a service in the transaction domain for cyberspace. As Ecommerce becomes more prevelant and online transactions continue to become more commonplace they are helping compaines such as Venmo and Acorns use their technologies to achieve their objective.

They provide customers of banks with secure ways to access their accounts. Recently companies, such as PayPal, have had to link customer's bank accounts by taking some amount out of their account and confirming with the customer that this was correct. This can take days and is not the most efficient process. Plaid fixes this problem and, although, the banks have to agree to connect with Plaid, more than 10,000 of them have done so. They are not very big at the moment and need to expand the use of their technology if they want to grow larger than their predecessors.

**VERDICT
Ultimately Plaid has a strong foothold on the market for the services they provide. However, as more competitiors rise in the marketplace to compete they will need to continue to improve services that attract busineeses such as security and cloud API which their competitiors are advertising to their advantage.
